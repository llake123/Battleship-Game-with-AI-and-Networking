# Battleship-Game-with-AI-and-Networking
This is just an example of a project I did in Programming and problem solving II

â€¢	Battleship game with AI that can be played over network.
  o	Coded in Java
  o	Incorporated GUIs, sockets, protocols, and simple data structures. 

To run it find :
Battleship/out/artifacts/Battleship_jar/ 

run the server jar then the client jar

I've also included the code that I wrote for the program.
